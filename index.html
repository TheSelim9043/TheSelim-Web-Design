          <h3>HTML5 Markup</h3>
          <p>HTML5 addresses this shortcoming by defining specific tags to indicate clearly what role is played by the content those tags contain. That explicit information helps robots/crawlers like Google and Bing to understand better which content is important, which is a subsidiary, which is for navigation, and so on.</p>

          <p>Cascading Style Sheets (Cascading Style Templates or Cascading Format Sheets, known as CSS ) is a markup language that offers extra possibilities in the field of text and formatting in addition to HTML .

            It allows you to create generic templates for Internet pages, or it can be used to independently change the style of letters, that is, their properties such as color, font, size. The most important feature of this technique is its flexibility in use.</p>
